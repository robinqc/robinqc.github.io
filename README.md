# @robinqc Blog [Future landing page and portfolio]

I started this project just to have a place where i can upload bits of knowledge i know i'll go back to and use in the future. Maybe somebody else finds it useful too...




## What i'm using

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) to dynamically generate the static files served to the readers, this is really cool
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) as my cloud managed database, writing backend is boring...
- Little bits of [React](https://react.dev/) here and there (i might be switching to something else like Preact or Solid, not that it affects much but i wanna try something new)
- Of course, [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host this
